# Minesweeper - Quick Start Guide

## Build and Run

```bash
# Navigate to the directory
cd /Users/sebastian/dev/tt/conf/ekon-2025-ai-coding/src/live-demo

# Build and run in one command
./build-run.sh

# Or separately
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

## How to Play

### Mouse Controls
- **Left Click**: Reveal a cell
- **Right Click**: Toggle flag on a cell
- **Ctrl + Click**: Alternative way to toggle flag (useful for trackpads)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **âŒ˜N**: New Game (restart current difficulty)
- **âŒ˜1**: Start Beginner mode (9Ã—9 grid)
- **âŒ˜2**: Start Intermediate mode (16Ã—16 grid)
- **âŒ˜3**: Start Expert mode (30Ã—16 grid)
- **âŒ˜Q**: Quit application

### Game Modes
- **Beginner**: 9Ã—9 grid with 8-12 mines
- **Intermediate**: 16Ã—16 grid with 30-50 mines
- **Expert**: 30Ã—16 grid with 70-99 mines

### Objective
Reveal all cells that don't contain mines without clicking on a mine.

### Symbols
- **Numbers (1-8)**: Show how many mines are adjacent to that cell
- **ðŸš© Flag**: Mark cells you think contain mines
- **ðŸ’£ Bomb**: Revealed mine (game over)
- **Empty cells**: No adjacent mines

### Tips
- The first click is always safe (mines are placed after)
- Clicking an empty cell (no adjacent mines) automatically reveals surrounding cells
- Use flags to mark suspected mines
- The timer starts when you make your first click

```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "command not found: fpc"
You need to install FreePascal Compiler:
```bash
brew install fpc
```

### Build fails with linker errors
Make sure you have Xcode command line tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Application doesn't show menu bar
This is handled automatically by calling `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular)`.
If you still don't see it, try clicking on the application icon in the Dock.

### Colors don't match specification
The implementation uses the exact colors from requirements.md:
- Unrevealed: `NSColor.lightGrayColor`
- Flagged: `NSColor.orangeColor`
- Revealed empty: `NSColor.colorWithCalibratedWhite_alpha(0.92, 1.0)`
- Mine: `NSColor.redColor`

## What's Implemented

âœ… Native macOS UI using Cocoa bindings
âœ… Custom NSView with direct drawing (NSBezierPath)
âœ… Sharp rectangular cells (no rounded corners)
âœ… All three difficulty modes
âœ… Proper menu bar with keyboard shortcuts
âœ… Mouse event handling (left/right/Ctrl+click)
âœ… First-click safety (mines placed after first click)
âœ… Flood fill algorithm for empty cells
âœ… Timer display
âœ… Mine counter display
âœ… Win/loss detection with alerts
âœ… Color-coded numbers (1=green, 2=dark green, 3=yellow, 4=orange, 5+=red)
âœ… Window title updates on game state
âœ… Clean separation of game logic and UI
âœ… Proper memory management

## Architecture Highlights

### Hybrid Pattern
- **Regular Pascal class** (`TGameData`): Handles all game state and logic
- **Objective-C classes**: Handle only macOS UI integration
  - `TMinesweeperView`: Custom NSView for rendering
  - `TGameController`: Application controller

### Why Hybrid?
FreePascal's Objective-C support has limitations:
- All methods in objcclass must have `message` directives
- Dynamic arrays not supported in objcclass fields
- Solution: Keep game logic in regular Pascal class, UI in objcclass

### Custom Drawing
The game board is rendered using:
- `NSBezierPath.fillRect()` for cell backgrounds
- `NSBezierPath.strokeRect()` for cell borders
- `NSString.drawInRect_withAttributes()` for centered text
- No NSButton controls (as required)
